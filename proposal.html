    <h1>Project 2 Site Redesign Proposal</h1>
    <sec>
    <p>For Project 2 I will be redesigning the Green Education Foundation website. The Green Education Foundation is a non-profit with the goal of creating a more sustainable future through education. Right now, the website is navigable, but is organized poorly and not aesthetically pleasing:<p>

     <p>The goal of this redesign will be to better organize the site, as well as make it more pleasing and interesting to view. The redesign will be aimed towards educators and students, who view the site looking for resources and educational curriculum. By Friday of next week (4/17), I will have the navigation done, as well as the home page and one other page. The next Friday, (4/24), I will have two more pages done. Lastly, the following Friday (5/1), I will have remaining page done as well as all of the content and technical requirements for the Project 2 Final Submission.</p>
