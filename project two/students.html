    <h2>What Does Sustainability Mean?</h2>
    <p>Green schools, green products, green jobs. But what does it mean? Today, being green means living a sustainable lifestyle and incorporating sustainability education in the classroom. Sustainability is more than recycling and composting. Sustainability education uses a wide lens to understand the big picture - the environment, economy, and society. From this perspective, your decisions and actions become more meaningful and the opportunities to be a change-maker stand out.</p>
        <p>GEF is here to put the right tools in your tool belt so that you can make a difference. Here, you can find activities for your home or class, free contests with great prizes, or local youth groups that share your interests.</p>
