Sustainability education provides educators with the real-world applied learning models that connect science, technology, and math education with the broader human concerns of environmental, economic, and social systems. GEF provides curriculum and resources to K-12 students and teachers worldwide with the goal of challenging them to think holistically and critically about global environmental concerns and solutions.</p>
    <p>GEF Institute, a division of GEF, is a virtual classroom established to meet increasing market demand for sustainability focused courses. The Institute builds on GEF's expertise by offering affordable courses in sustainability to educators, students at the high school and undergraduate level, employees and professionals.
