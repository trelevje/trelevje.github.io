    <h2>Welcome to your online home for sustainability education!</h2>
          <p>GEF has the curriculum, programs, and support you need to bring high-quality sustainability education to your classroom and community. Now, GEF has the resources to help you earn academic credit or CEUs while building your knowledge and skills around sustainability education.</p>

          <p>Sustainability Education is more than being environmentally friendly. Sustainability Education takes a holistic approach to learning that incorporates environmental, economic, and social perspectives to frame childrenâ€™s experiences in the classroom and community. Our goal is to help you integrate sustainability into your existing curricula by developing all levels of national standards based lessons to be used as supplements to individual lessons or as stand-alone, semester long, programs of study. </p>
