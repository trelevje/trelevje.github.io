    <h1>Independent Project Proposal</h1>
    <sec>
    <p>For my Independent Project I wish to build a website off of a business plan that I made last semester, to create a well-rounded portfolio piece. I named the company "Clean Edit Co." and the idea behind the brand was to create an online marketplace for ethically sourced, organic beauty products. Therefore, my project deliverables will include a full business proposal re-vamped and upgraded, including user research and personas, as well as a site prototype. The website will aim to provide usability and accessibility to all customers by complying with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). With that goal in mind, the design of the website will be centered around accessibility standards for people with disabilities.  </p>
    <p>My primary target audience will include women, aged 18-34 years old, high school to college educated, and middle to upper-class. Demographics based off of 2020 statistics regarding the heaviest buyers of beauty products. Aesthetically, this will be the site design main target. However, the site and company itself will be designed with the goal of inclusivity. </p>
    <p>By week 4 of our class, I will have done more competition research as well as site inspiration research, by sketching out designs, adding to mood boards for the site, etc. I will also start the site design as well as the user research for my site business proposal and working on the completion certificates for week 5. Week 6 I will work on the site and business proposals further, to have my deliverables finalized for week 7.</p>
